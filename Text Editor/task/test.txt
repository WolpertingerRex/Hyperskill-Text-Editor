The first thing to point out is that the "Save" and "Load" buttons take up a lot of space on the screen. 
You can't add a lot of buttons to the top bar when they contain text. This problem can be solved using icons instead of text. 
The constructor of JButton can take an ImageIcon instead of text. You should replace the buttons "Load" and "Save"
 with corresponding icons. You can download the icons from the internet.
